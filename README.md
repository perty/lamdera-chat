# A chat on the Lamdera platform

Lamdera is a platform that allows you to write both the frontend and 
backend in Elm. It is multi-user, push to client and persistent
out of the box.

# Chat

A chat would be a good example to start trying out Lamdera.

The multi-user aspect is handled straight out of the box,
as said. But there will certainly be problems down the road.
